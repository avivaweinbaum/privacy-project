	<h2>Why knowing about Terms and Conditions/Privacy Policies are important: </h2>

    <p>Terms and conditions act as a binding contract between the user and service while privacy policies demonstrate how user's personal information is being handled. In both circumstances, it is important to understand the information you are agreeing to. Understanding these allows users to have more control over their privacy and be able to make more informed decisions about which products to use.

    <h2>How to find Terms and Conditions/Privacy Policies: </h2>

    <p> Terms and conditions are not required by law, but privacy policies are. Almost all laws, such as the CalOPPA (California Online Privacy Protection Act), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, in Europe), and PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) require privacy policies to be easy to find. The most common place a privacy policy can be found is in the footer of a webpage. Sometimes users will encounter terms and conditions on sign up forms or on checkout or sign in pages. If a user can not find the privacy policy in any of these places, the website is probably shady.
