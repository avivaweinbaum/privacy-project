    <h2>About <b>Watch Out</b></h2>
	<p> Watch Out produces a clear analysis of Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies in order to help users make 
	    informed decisions about the websites and apps they choose to interact with. 
	    The analysis highlights key phrases in order to explain what data the platform is collecting, as well as 
	    the ways this data is being collected, used, and shared with third parties.   

	    Watch Out was designed in 2019 by three students as a final project for their privacy class. 
	    This platform hopes to address the lack of accessibility of Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies 
	    by providing users with a better understanding of what they are agreeing to when checking “yes” to use 
	    apps and websites.
